AI Compliance Pipeline
What is this project?
This project is a simple tool that helps check if AI models are fair and if data contains any sensitive personal information. With new rules in the EU and around the world about how AI should behave, these kinds of checks are becoming really important.

Why does it matter?
AI systems can sometimes be biased — for example, treating some groups unfairly. Also, personal information like names or emails shouldn’t accidentally be exposed or misused. This project helps spot these issues early.

What does it do?
Bias Check: It looks at predictions from an AI model and compares how different groups are treated to see if any group is unfairly favored or disadvantaged.

PII Check: It scans input data for things like names, phone numbers, emails, or IDs that might be private or sensitive.

How to use it
Download or clone this repository.

Set up your computer to run Python programs (instructions below).

Run the bias check or PII check scripts to see if your AI model or data passes these tests.

Who is this for?
AI developers who want to make sure their models are fair.

Data scientists who need to protect private information.

Anyone interested in ethical AI and data privacy.

Getting started
If you want to try it yourself:

Make sure you have Python installed.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate it:

Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the bias check:

bash
Copy
Edit
python checks/bias_check.py
Run the PII check:

bash
Copy
Edit
python checks/pii_check.py
What’s next?
This is a starting point! The tools here can be improved with:

More advanced fairness checks

Deeper PII scanning

Integration into continuous workflows so checks happen automatically
