# 🤖 AI Compliance Pipeline

## What is this project?  
This is a simple tool to help check if AI models are **fair** and if data contains any **sensitive personal information**. With new AI regulations coming into force in the EU and worldwide, these checks are more important than ever.

---

## Why does it matter?  
AI systems can sometimes be **biased**, treating some groups unfairly. Also, private info like names or emails shouldn’t accidentally be exposed or misused. This project helps spot these problems early.

---

## What does it do?  
- 🔍 **Bias Check:** Compares AI predictions across different groups to detect unfair treatment.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **PII Check:** Scans data to find Personally Identifiable Information like names, phone numbers, emails, or IDs.
